# House Price Prediction ML Project

## Overview
This project predicts house prices using machine learning models: **LightGBM**, **XGBoost**, and **Gradient Boosting**.  
The dataset is the **Ames Housing dataset**, which contains 2,930 records, 80 features (both numerical and categorical).

## Features
- Data cleaning and missing value handling
- Encoding categorical variables
- Model training and evaluation
- Feature importance visualization for Gradient Boosting

## Models and Performance
| Model                 | Mean Absolute Error (MAE) |
|----------------------|---------------------------|
| Gradient Boosting     | ~20,300                   |
| XGBoost               | ~17,580                   |
| LightGBM              | ~17,512                   |

**MAE** is the average difference between the predicted and actual house prices. Lower is better.
